                My favorite hobby is programming because it's fun. Programming is fun because if you have the knowledge and creativity you can make anything. I'm ten years old and I have a very curious mind which I think is good for programming. Programming gives you a longer attention span because you need to spend a lot of time to make and debug your programs. Programming will also make you more creative because you can look at other fellow programmers to get inspiration.
