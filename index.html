            <p>Geronimo Stilton is an Italian children's book series written by Elisabetta Dami (though the covers claim they were written by the title character).[1] On older novels, the copyright is issued to a pseudonym "Geronimo Stilton"; this was changed on newer books. The books are intended for readers in the 8 - 12 year-old age range. The books are also intended for readers on the N level.

Scholastic Corporation has published the English version of the series in the US since February 2004, and the books are published by Sweet Cherry Publishing in the UK.

The series has sold over 180 million copies worldwide, and with 249 editions it is one of the best-selling book series ever written.[2] The books have been translated into 49 languages. [3]

In the series, the title character is an anthropomorphic mouse who lives in the fictional New Mouse City on fictional Mouse Island. A best-selling author, Geronimo Stilton[4] works as a journalist and editor for the fictional newspaper The Rodent's Gazette.<br><br>

He has a younger sister named Thea Stilton,[5] a cousin named Trap Stilton,[5] and a favourite nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton (Ben) and also Petelina Pretty Paws. Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who would like nothing better than to live a quiet life, but he keeps getting involved in faraway adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin, and sometimes Aunt Sweetfur. The books are written as though they are autobiographical adventure stories.

Papercutz obtained the rights to publish English translations of the graphic novels of Geronimo Stilton. These retain some of the original names of the characters that were changed in the storybooks translated by Scholastic. For example, the English translations of the graphic novels by Papercutz continue to use the names "Patty Spring" and "Pandora", while the storybooks by Scholastic changed these names to Petunia Pretty Paws and Bugsy Wugsy, respectively.</p>

    <p>Dami is the daughter of publisher Piero Dami (who founded Dami Editore in 1972). At the age of thirteen she started out in the publishing world as a proofreader for the family business and at nineteen she wrote her first short stories. As an adventure lover, she got her aircraft pilot and parachutist licenses aged 20, and at 23 she traveled around the world on her own and completed a famous survival course at the Outward Bound School in Maine, in the United States.[1] Some of Dami's other adventures include taking part in a rally in the Sahara desert and crossing Africa from north to south in an off-road vehicle; she raced the 100-km Sahara ultramarathon and ran three New York marathons (in 2002, 2003, and 2017).Her experience as a volunteer with sick kids and children gave her the idea of writing adventure stories with a mouse called Geronimo Stilton as the protagonist.<br><br> These stories went on to become a famous publishing sensation in Italy and internationally.[3] This was mainly because she found out in 1990 she could not have kids. So she decided to volunteer in a children's hospital. Caring for sick kids.[4]

For a while I worked as a volunteer in a hospital, and it was there, almost by chance, that I invented Geronimo Stilton â€¦ It was at the time when Patch Adams taught the world that children need to laugh to get better. So I started to make up funny stories in which the protagonist was a clumsy mouse called Geronimo Stilton. He would get involved in all sorts of entertaining adventures, full of funny events and twists in the plot, that children found really compelling.[5]

Since then Geronimo Stilton's stories have been translated into 49 languages[6] and have sold more than 161 million copies all over the world.[7]<br><br>This is a biography by Dami ,I love to travel and explore the natural environments of the Earth, near and far away: the Sahara desert, the North Pole glaciers, the Nepali forests and the Himalayan peaks, but also the sands of the the Australian outback, the majestic Victoria Falls, and the fascinating biodiversity of the tropical forest of Central Africa Republic.

I also love to visit the WWF Oasis (World Wildlife Fund Natural Reservations in Italy), where nature is loved and protected. I have a passion for archaeology and I visited legendary sites like the mysterious Machu Pichu and the ruins of Peru, the Giza Pyramids in Egypt, but but also the ones of Chichen Itza in Mexico, and the stones circle of Stonehenge in Great Britain. I love all the countries in the world, each has its beauty and its fascinating unicity, but I always have in my heart the Country where I was born and I live, Italy. I visited the wildest nature environments, I met different people and cultures, making many new friends, and from each of them I learnt a lot: it is so touching to share different experiences and traditions!</p>
